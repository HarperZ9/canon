"""Read a SQLite database and its write-ahead log without opening them in SQLite.

`open_shared` opens a file for reading only. On Windows it also allows other
processes to delete or rename the file while it is open, so a writer that ends
a transaction or leaves WAL mode is never blocked by a reader.

`wal_image` applies the committed frames of a WAL file to a database image by
the recovery rules in the SQLite file format: a frame counts only when its salts
match the WAL header and its running checksum verifies, and frames after the
last valid commit frame are ignored. The result is an image in rollback-journal
form for `sqlite3.Connection.deserialize`. Nothing is written to disk.
