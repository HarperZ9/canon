"""What a purge selects: one event, an ordinal cut-off, or every event.

A selection resolves against a `ScopeView`, the events of one workspace and
project with their derived records and the answers paired with each of them.
With `keep_responses`, the bulk selectors (`before_ord` and `all`) leave out
every answer, meaning every event with `message_role: "assistant"`, whether
its prompt is selected, was purged earlier, was never captured or is not named
at all (D-165). An answer named by its own event id is purged as named.
