"""Stop deliveries: the client's last assistant message as a paired answer event.

Response capture is off unless the hook runs with `--capture prompts+responses`
(or `CANON_CONTEXT_CAPTURE`). Then a Stop delivery stores the client's
`last_assistant_message` as an assistant event. It is linked to the prompt
event captured for the same `prompt_id` (Claude Code) or `turn_id` (Codex) by a
`canon_event_ref` source and by `responds_to`, which is what a purge follows
when it removes a prompt together with its answer.

The answer's event id is `<native_id>-response-<segment>`. Reusing the prompt's
native id would give the answer the prompt's identity with different content,
which the store refuses as a collision. A redelivered Stop with the same text
is idempotent at its segment; a different answer for the same prompt, as when a
Stop hook asks the client to continue, takes the next segment.

An answer is stored only when the prompt it answers is in the store. The store
checks this inside the transaction that writes the answer (D-164), so a purge
of the prompt that lands while the hook runs still takes the answer with it.
A Stop whose prompt was purged, or never captured (a Claude Code prompt that arrived without a
`prompt_id` is stored under a generated id no Stop can name), stores nothing
and says which. The answer text passes through the secret scrubber first, as
a prompt does. The event records that tool calls and reasoning were not
captured. A Stop the hook does not store always returns a message saying why,
so a hook mounted on Stop never fails silently.
