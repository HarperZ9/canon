"""Retention: canon's retention planner (retention.py) applied to the context store.

A policy file names captured events, each with one planner action. The planner
validates each entry, and each action becomes a purge target: `tombstone` and
`purge-all` remove the event and its derived records, and, as a purge does, the
paired answer unless the file sets `keep_responses`; `purge-derived` removes
only the derived records, which the policy must cover by naming the `sqlite`
store; `retain` keeps everything. A run is one purge plan, confirmed by its
digest like any other, and each tombstone names the rule as its reason code.

An event an earlier run already purged is listed as already purged, so a
policy can run again after it applied. A policy that retains an answer, or
purges only its derived records, while another entry removes that answer with
its prompt is refused; `keep_responses` is the way to keep answers.

A policy that asks a tombstone to keep a content hash is refused: context
tombstones hold none, so nothing kept after a purge confirms what it removed.
