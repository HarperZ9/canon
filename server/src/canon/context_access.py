"""Whether other accounts on this machine can read or replace the context database.

canon sets no file permissions of its own. On Windows the database and its
journal inherit the ACL of their folder; on POSIX SQLite creates them with the
process umask applied, whatever the folder allows. On POSIX the check reads
the mode bits. The database is `shared` when its group or other bits
grant anything, or when its directory is writable by group or other, since an
account that can write the directory can replace the file. On Windows access
is governed by ACLs this check does not read, so it reports `not_checked`
rather than a guess.
