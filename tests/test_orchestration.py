"""test_orchestration.py -- R1: writing a harness's whole surface set.

write_surfaces renders every catalog surface from one pool, choosing each
surface's content by the authored-split rule: a global file carries the
globals; a workspace file carries only workspace-authored blocks when the same
harness also has a global surface (Claude Code's two CLAUDE.md files), and the
full merged set when it does not (Codex's lone AGENTS.md). A host that has not
opted in (no canon region) is skipped and reported, never mutated.

Fake roots and injected IO keep every real path out of the repo.
