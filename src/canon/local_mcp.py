"""local_mcp.py -- serve canon over MCP so a harness can read the record set.

canon renders instruction files from one typed record. Everything that reads
those records lived inside this repository until now, which meant a harness
holding the files canon writes had no way to ask canon what it believes. This
is that door: the authored block set, the resolved render for a scope, the
validator, and the aggregate check, over zero-dep stdio JSON-RPC 2.0.

The server writes nothing. Every tool here reads: no surface is spliced, no
vault is mirrored, no gate is raised. Reconcile is an action with a human gate
behind it, and an action does not belong on a door any tool can knock on.

`handle()` is transport-free and testable; `serve()` is the thin stdio loop.
