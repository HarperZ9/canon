"""backends/base.py -- the storage seam: the MemoryBackend Protocol.

F1 fixes the one interface every store adapter satisfies, so the renderer, the
migration legs, and the round-trip proof (R0) speak to a store through a single
shape and never to a concrete engine. A backend holds canonical Records and
hands them back field-identical -- except for the fields it has openly declared
it cannot hold. That honesty is the whole contract: `declared_drops()` names,
in capability tokens, what a round-trip through this backend loses, and `put()`
refuses a record that would lose a field silently.

Two kinds of drop live here. A *record-enforceable* drop is one a single record
can trigger by its own fields; F0's envelope has exactly one such capability,
`temporal` (a record carrying a live `valid_until` or `supersedes`). `guard_put`
refuses such a record on a backend that dropped the capability, so the loss is
never silent: the caller must `flatten()` first and thereby opt into it. A
*structural* drop (`arbitrary-kind`, `relations`, `audit-chain`,
`foreign-provenance`) is a property of the store, not of one record's fields; it
is declared and documented but cannot be triggered by a lone record, so
`guard_put` does not raise on it. Kind support is enforced separately, by
`supported_kinds()`.

canon stays self-contained: this module imports only the schema and validator. The two
adapters that map external engines (mneme, flywheel) take an injected store
handle rather than importing the engine, so the container carries no runtime
dependency on either.
