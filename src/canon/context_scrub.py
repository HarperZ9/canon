"""The byte-level half of a context purge: scrub the SQLite files, then scan them.

The purge connection sets secure_delete, so SQLite overwrites deleted content
with zeros, and keeps temporary storage in memory, so VACUUM writes no
transient copy of the database to the temp directory. After the purge commits,
VACUUM rebuilds the file from the live rows. A database another tool switched
to WAL is checkpointed with TRUNCATE before and after VACUUM, and a reader that
holds the WAL open is reported, since its snapshot keeps the old pages.

A purge marks the store scrub-pending in the transaction that removes the
rows and clears the mark once VACUUM and the checkpoints have run. A purge
interrupted between its commit and its scrub leaves the mark, and the next
confirmed purge, even one with nothing left to remove, runs the scrub.

The residual scan then reads the database and its -journal, -wal and -shm
files and looks for the purged values in the forms a record envelope stores
them. Values shorter than 16 bytes are checked only by their rows being gone.
Longer values are cut into 16-byte windows; any run of at least
`min_detectable_bytes` of a purged value left in those files is found, and
occurrences that rows the purge kept still account for are not residue.

Counting those occurrences is where a kept record that quotes the purged text
costs time: every window it quotes is found. A few found windows are counted
one at a time at C speed; past `_DIRECT_WINDOWS` of them, one pass over every
offset of the files and of the kept text counts them all, so the work stays
linear in the bytes read.
