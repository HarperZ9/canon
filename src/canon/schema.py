"""schema.py -- the one canonical record for the memory-bank container.

F0 fixes a single record envelope that every backend adapter and every
render target aims at, so no downstream slice invents its own shape. A
record is provider-neutral: it does not know whether it came from a Claude
transcript, a ChatGPT export, a Hermes SOUL.md, or an authored block, and it
does not know which store will hold it. Five kinds share one envelope:

  personality-block        an authored block of the operator's canon
  episodic-memory          a raw turn or an extracted fact (mneme L0/L1/L2)
  synthesized-persona-l3   a persona profile synthesized from facts (mneme L3)
  adr-decision             a decision record (shape here; placement in F3)
  research-artifact-ref    a content-addressed reference to external research

The envelope carries a provenance receipt on every record and a temporal
block on the kinds that support supersede/valid_until. Ordering prefers a
clock-free ordinal (`create_ord`) over the wall clock so a rebuild from the
same inputs is byte-identical; `create_time` is kept only as a nullable,
non-authoritative convenience.

This module is pure data. It imports no store and writes no file. The
storage seam (the MemoryBackend Protocol and its adapters) is F1; the
declared drops each backend must announce are recorded in
project-docs/F0-DECLARED-DROPS.md and enforced there, not here.
