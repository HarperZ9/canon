"""File IO for `canon handoff` and `canon switch`, with every failure named.

A file that cannot be read as UTF-8 text, a path whose parent is a file, a
permission error, a destination that already exists: each becomes a refusal
with a stable failure code, so a `--json` caller always gets a result object
and never a traceback. A link found on the way to an instruction file is
refused again at write time, and a file `switch --create` makes is opened in
exclusive mode, so a link or a file planted between the plan and the write
makes the write fail rather than land somewhere else.
