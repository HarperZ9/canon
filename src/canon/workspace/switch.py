"""switch.py -- put the brief where the next agent reads it on its own.

Switching to a target renders that target's workspace instruction file region:
the project's personality blocks (by the authored-split rule the rest of canon
uses) followed by one generated block holding the resume brief. The target
loads its instruction file at startup, so the brief reaches it without a paste.

The write goes through the same allow-list and region rules as every other
canon write: only a catalog surface, reached through no link, only between the
canon markers, and only into a file that already carries a region, or into a
file that does not exist yet when the caller asks for it to be created. The
host checks (links, the region, line endings, Codex's override file and byte
budget) are in `switch_host.py`. The brief is fitted to its budget as the block
that lands in the file, sentinel included, and the receipt carries the digest
of that block and of the whole region interior. IO is injected, so planning
reads and commit writes are separate steps.
