"""pool.py -- the record pool one project's render may read.

The renderers (surface, handoff, switch) never open a store file themselves.
They take the pool this module assembles, so the isolation rule lives in one
place: global rows, the project's own accepted rows, and the accepted rows of
any other project the caller named. A proposed row is never in a pool.

A declared foreign project is read, not merged. When a foreign personality
block shares an id with one of this project's blocks, layering would let one
override the other silently, so the pool refuses instead.
