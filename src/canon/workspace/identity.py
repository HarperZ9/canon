"""identity.py -- a stable identity for the project a record belongs to.

A developer who moves one repository between Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and a
local model wants every tool to see that repository's records and no other
repository's. The store keys everything on a project id, so the id has to be
stable across the things that do not change the project (a second clone, a new
working directory, a different tool) and different across the things that do.

Derivation, in order:

  1. The repository root is the nearest directory at or above the workspace that
     holds a `.git` entry (a directory, or the file a worktree or submodule
     carries). A workspace with no `.git` above it is its own root.
  2. A `canon.project` name in the repository's git config names the project
     explicitly and wins over the remote. It splits two checkouts that share a
     remote but are different projects (two apps cloned from one starter).
  3. With a remote, the id is derived from the normalized remote URL alone:
     scheme, credentials, query and a trailing `.git` are dropped, the host is
     lowercased, and a port is dropped only when it is the scheme's default.
     Two clones of one repository share an id wherever they sit on disk. The
     remote is `origin` when present, else the first remote by name, so the
     choice does not depend on file order.
  4. With no remote, a repository is keyed on a random nonce canon writes once
     into its shared git directory, so moving it keeps its id and a new `git
     init` at a reused path is a new project. A directory with no git directory,
     or one canon cannot write, is keyed on its resolved path.

A merge the rules cannot see (two apps started from one starter repository keep
its remote) is announced rather than silent: the store records a digest of each
checkout root that used the project, and a command run from a new one says so.

The path of a case-sensitive repository host is kept as written. Two remotes
that differ only by path case therefore get two ids. That split is deliberate:
when in doubt the derivation separates two projects rather than merging them,
because a merge shows one project's records to another and a split only hides
records until they are adopted explicitly.

The id is a digest, so nothing in it names a local path, a user name or a
credential. `label` is the human name shown in a brief: the normalized remote,
or the root directory's name for the path method.
