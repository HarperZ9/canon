"""moves.py -- the two explicit ways a record crosses a project boundary.

`promote` moves an accepted record from one project to global scope, where
every project reads it. `adopt` copies another project's accepted records into
this project, for the case the identity rules cannot see: a repository with no
remote that moved on disk, or a remote that was renamed. Both take a reason,
both write a log entry naming the other side, and neither runs on its own.
