"""switch_host.py -- what a switch checks about the host file before writing it.

- The path. The allow-list check is lexical, so the file and every directory
  above it inside the workspace are also checked for a symlink, junction or
  other reparse point, which would carry the write outside the repository or
  onto another surface. `canon.path_policy` does the check.
- The region. A file is written only when it carries exactly one canon region
  of workspace scope; the refusal for a file with none prints the two marker
  lines to add.
- The line endings. A host whose begin marker ends in CRLF gets a CRLF
  interior, so a file stays one line-ending style and an EOL-only difference
  is not a change.
- Codex. Codex reads AGENTS.override.md instead of AGENTS.md when both sit in a
  directory, so a switch that would write a file Codex never reads is refused.
  Codex also applies one byte budget (`project_doc_max_bytes`, 32768 unless
  ~/.codex/config.toml sets another) to every AGENTS file from the project root
  down to the working directory, so the root file is refused past the budget
  and a nested file the combined chain would cut is named in a warning.
