"""store.py -- one record store per project, and the rule that keeps them apart.

Layout under a store root (default `~/.canon/store`, or `CANON_STORE`):

    projects/<project_id>/records.jsonl    accepted rows for that project
    projects/<project_id>/proposed.jsonl   proposed rows awaiting a decision
    projects/<project_id>/log.jsonl        every write, promotion and decision
    projects/<project_id>/project.json     the path-clean identity
    global/records.jsonl                   rows promoted to global scope
    global/log.jsonl                       every promotion into global

Isolation is enforced on read, not assumed from the directory name. Every row
names its project, and reading a file refuses the whole file when any row names
a different project: a misfiled row is corruption, so it is reported rather than
filtered out. Another project's records are reachable only through
`pool.visible_records(..., include_projects=...)`, which reads that project's
own file and tags every record with the project it came from.

New records land in `workspace` scope for the store's project. The store refuses
a `global` record on `put`; `moves.promote` is the only way into global scope,
and it writes a log entry in both the project log and the global log.

Writers take the run lock for the project (and for global during a promotion),
so two processes cannot interleave a read-modify-write on one file.
