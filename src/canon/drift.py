"""drift.py -- V2: the rendered-surface drift check.

A managed surface's region interior is a pure function of the record pool. R1's
render composition (render_surface over pool_for) has no clock and no
randomness, so re-deriving a surface from the pool is byte-stable. This band
re-derives each catalog surface, compares the derived interior to what is on
disk, and returns a sha256-keyed verdict per surface. It reads; it never writes.

It scores canon-owned bytes: the region interior between the markers, not the
whole host file. The prefix and suffix are hand-authored and preserved by
construction, so a change there is the host's own prose, never canon drift. A
change inside the region is drift.

Total, like the fidelity gate: every refusal (a deformed marker, a mis-scoped
region, a render the pool cannot represent) is returned as a verdict, never
raised. drift_exit_code maps a report to a process status so a caller can gate a
build on it.
